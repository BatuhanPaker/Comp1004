# Comp1004
Comp 1004 This is my folder for the comp1004 project. To be able to use this file, please open your command promt. Go in to the file path where the server.js located. After that you type the command "node server.js" and the server will be activated on the port 3000. Keep in mind that you need to have node.js server installed on your computer. After installing and succesfully opening the server, you can go to your browser and type "http://localhost:3000". This will connect you to the application. The application is now useable.  
In this Application the goal was to host a server that can support the a local chat room that people can message each other in.
The messages written in the chat container can also be saved to a JSON file and are able to be called back when the user clicks the load messsage button.
Able to set usernames to identify separate users.
And seamless real-time chatting.
